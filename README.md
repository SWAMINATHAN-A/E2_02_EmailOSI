Project 2_E2_OSI Email Communication


Overview

This project is an interactive educational web application that visually demonstrates how an email travels from a sender's laptop to the recipient using the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model.
Each OSI layer is explained step-by-step, showing what happens to the data as it moves through the layers during email transmission.

The goal of the project is to make networking concepts — especially the OSI model — intuitive and beginner-friendly using visuals, animations, and simple explanations.

Features

Visual flow from Laptop → Internet → Mail Server → Recipient

Breakdown of all seven OSI layers:

Application

Presentation

Session

Transport

Network

Data Link

Physical

Each layer explains what happens to the email at that stage:

How data is formatted

How sessions are created

How packets are routed

How bits travel physically across media

Packet capture view showing how data is encapsulated and decapsulated

Simplified UI for interactive learning

Tech Stack

This application is built with:

React + TypeScript

Vite (fast development & build system)

Tailwind CSS for styling

shadcn/ui for UI components

Project Goals

Demonstrate real-world use of the OSI model

Help networking students visualize email transmission

Provide a modern and interactive learning interface

Deployment

The project can be deployed directly from Lovable (Share → Publish), or exported and hosted on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
